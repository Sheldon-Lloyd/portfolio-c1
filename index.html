        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Sheldon Lloyd growing up I have always considered myself a hobbyist comic creator. Although I got my first taste of programming high school it wasn't until college that I discovered that I might have a talent in it as well.</p>
        <p>My love of comics and a budding interest in coding formed the perfect marriage. This gave birth to my passion for web design and development. This is especially true if you consider how similar creating a website is to creating a comic book. The story, art, design, and layout of a comic are much like the design and UX stage of creating a website. One could even argue that the process of writing dialouge is akin to coding</p>
        <p>So far I have created a webcomic CMS and a webcomic bookmarking site. I have many other projects on the horizon. My goal is to get a job as a <span style="color:green">full-stack web developer or designer</span>. My dream is to one day turn one of my projects into a company</p>
        <p>My background gives me the flexibility to join a team as a designer who knows how to code or a developer who understands design.</p>

        <h3>My journey to becoming a web developer</h3>
        <p> Growing up I was always into comics and I wanted to create my own franchise like Marvel and dc. I decided the best way for me to distribute them would be through the Internet. At the time I didn't know about webcomics. This is how I got into web development, at the time I had no idea it could be a career. </p>
        <p> So when It came time to pick a high school I choose performing arts as my first choice and hutch tech as my second. Then came my rejection letter. Since Hutch-Tech usually did not take students that had them listed as a second choice as they were one of the top 2 high schools at the time I had no idea where I would go at this point. A few weeks later Hutch-Tech accepted me. Since they are an engineering school that became my new focus. </p>
        <p> Like a lot of teens, my hobbies began to revolve around things that would impress my peers. This meant that comics and web development fell by the wayside. But this is also when I got sports which taught me a lot of life lessons and is how I became interested in and learned a lot about health and fitness. </p>
        <p> when I got into college I choose to major in engineering until I realized it wasn't for me. This was also the time I got back into comics. So I decided to major in management information systems and media studies this is when learned that I could make a career out of web development. </p>
        <p> I still dreamt of creating my own comic franchise. This is what brought me to create my first website from scratch applying everything I learned. </p>
