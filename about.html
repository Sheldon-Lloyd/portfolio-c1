        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Sheldon Lloyd growing up I have always considered myself a hobbist comic creator. Although I got my first taste of programing highschool it wasn't until college that I discovered that I might have a talent in it as well.</p>
        <p>My love of comics and budding intrest in coding formed the perfect marriage. This gave birth to my passion for web design and developed. This is especially true if you consider ho similar creating a website is to creating a comic book. The story, art, design and layout of a comic is much like the design and UX stage of creating a website. One could even argue that the process of writing dialouge is akin to coding</p>
        <p>So far I have created a webcomic CMS and a webcomic bookmarking site. I have many other projects on the horizon. My goal is to is to get a job as a fullstack web devloper or designer. My dream is to one day turn one of my projects into a company</p>
        <p>My background gives the flexabilty to join a team as a designer that know how to code or a developer that understands design.</p>
